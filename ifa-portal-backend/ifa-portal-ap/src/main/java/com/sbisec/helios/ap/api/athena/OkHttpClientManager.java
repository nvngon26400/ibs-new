	/**
	 * Creates and returns a copy of this object. The precise meaning of "copy" may
	 * depend on the class of the object. The general intent is that, for any object
	 * {@code x}, the expression: <blockquote>
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * x.clone() != x
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * </blockquote> will be true, and that the expression: <blockquote>
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * </blockquote> will be {@code true}, but these are not absolute requirements.
	 * While it is typically the case that: <blockquote>
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * x.clone().equals(x)
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * </blockquote> will be {@code true}, this is not an absolute requirement.
	 * <p>
	 * By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling
	 * {@code super.clone}. If a class and all of its superclasses (except
	 * {@code Object}) obey this convention, it will be the case that
	 * {@code x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()}.
	 * <p>
	 * By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent of
	 * this object (which is being cloned). To achieve this independence, it may be
	 * necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned by
	 * {@code super.clone} before returning it. Typically, this means copying any
	 * mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure" of the object
	 * being cloned and replacing the references to these objects with references to
	 * the copies. If a class contains only primitive fields or references to
	 * immutable objects, then it is usually the case that no fields in the object
	 * returned by {@code super.clone} need to be modified.
	 * <p>
	 * The method {@code clone} for class {@code Object} performs a specific cloning
	 * operation. First, if the class of this object does not implement the
	 * interface {@code Cloneable}, then a {@code CloneNotSupportedException} is
	 * thrown. Note that all arrays are considered to implement the interface
	 * {@code Cloneable} and that the return type of the {@code clone} method of an
	 * array type {@code T[]} is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive
	 * type. Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
	 * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of the
	 * corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the contents of the
	 * fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method performs a "shallow copy"
	 * of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
	 * <p>
	 * The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface
	 * {@code Cloneable}, so calling the {@code clone} method on an object whose
	 * class is {@code Object} will result in throwing an exception at run time.
	 *
	 * @return a clone of this instance.
	 * @throws CloneNotSupportedException if the object's class does not support the
	 * {@code Cloneable} interface. Subclasses that override the {@code clone}
	 * method can also throw this exception to indicate that an instance cannot be
	 * cloned.
	 * @see Cloneable
